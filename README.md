# 🎱 Billiard Tracker

A modern **C# WPF application** built with the **MVVM pattern** to track our billiard sessions in a clean and structured way.

This project focuses on simplicity, clarity, and maintainability — separating UI, logic, and data through MVVM to keep the codebase scalable and easy to extend.
